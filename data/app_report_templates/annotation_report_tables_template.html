<H3>"Annotate Plant Enzymes with OrthoFinder" Results</H3>

<p> The table presented here shows the results of the "Annotate Plant
Enzymes with OrthoFinder" App. In the output, all predicted enzymes in
the KBaseGenome object provided by the user have been annotated with
metabolic functions. The table provides the links between predicted
enzymes in the KBase Genome and the curated Arabidopsis enzymes in the
PlantSEED database. The columns of the table are explained as follows:
<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Enzyme</b>: The text describing the metabolic activity of the
enzyme.</li>

<li><b>Curated Feature</b>: The Arabidopsis proteins that were curated
to encode the corresponding enzyme. The table is organized so that
each Arabidopsis protein has its own row.</li>

<li><b>Predicted Ortholog</b>: The proteins in the input genome that
were predicted to be orthologous to the corresponding Arabidopsis
proteins, and therefore perform the same metabolic activity.</li>

<li><b>Potential Orthologs</b>: The proteins from the same protein
family. Each one is listed with the pairwise amino-acid sequence
identity calculated for its alignment with the corresponding
Arabidopsis protein. If the protein is red, that means it's linked to
the corresponding ortholog in the same row. If the protein is blue, it
means it is linked to an ortholog in a different row. If the protein
is black, it has no predicted link.</li>

</ul>

<p>We list only protein identifiers in this table because OrthoFinder
aligns protein sequences to find families. However, the App will
annotate both the proteins and their parent genes</p>
